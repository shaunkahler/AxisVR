# Axis Skatepark Revival - 3D VR Experience

This is a 3D recreation of *Axis Skatepark* — the legendary skatepark where I grew up. Axis was pure chaos and energy: all-nighters, murderball, skatepark tours, Friday night madness, best trick contests, bands, and fireworks on the highway. It was a once-in-a-lifetime place that eventually shut down after a massive expansion attempt.

Using YouTube footage and my memory of the original layout, dimensions, and ramp sizes, I rebuilt Axis in 3D and brought it back to life in VR. This project is a tribute to one of the greatest skateparks ever, preserving it in digital form for exploration and connection.

## Current Features
- Drive around the skatepark in a car
- Throw tennis balls around the environment
- Full 3D environment based on the original Axis layout and dimensions
- VR support for walking and exploring the park

## Planned Updates
- Improved lighting, shading, and environmental details
- Migration to an Unreal Engine build for enhanced graphics
- WebVR deployment for easier browser-based access and exploration

Axis isn't just a park — it's a piece of skateboarding history. Thanks for checking it out.
